                    <p>HIIII ig its time for me to write, write about me, you, about us? Maybe I'll yap enough to get to writing about that eventually, actually I don't even know what to write about. Wait, that's not true, it's just that I have so much to write about, I don't even know where to start. I have a feeling ima fall more in love just by writing this letter, but either way buckle in for pages and pages of straight yap. I HAVE AN IDEA, yk i promised you i'd tell u soon why i loved u or what i saw in you. The time is now. It has come. Time to reveal the secrets of the universe. If I had to condense what i saw in you short and sweet, I see you. Nithya Ravuri. All i've ever wanted, the intelligent, funny, reserved yet out of pocket, sweet yet dirty minded, cute yet hot girl i know. IG that's part of what makes u special, the balance that you have, in everything. The way u balance fun and academics the way u balance everything. I mean c'mon every time we do smth i keep thinking “bro u better not lose this girl ur never ever finding another one like her” and that's true. I mean cmon who the fuck is gonna do half the shit we do together?
<br><br>
 Right back to the topic I see in you the balance, the calmness yet the idk inner anger that i always wanted. What I see in you is my better, half as cringey and shit as that sounds, I feel like we complete each other. Soulmates. I see in you someone who I'll never get bored of and someone who will never ever get bored of me. Someone who i can tell anything and anything(tho i already do) and someone who i'll never have to hide myself from. Someone who’ll never hide themselves from me. Someone who managed to walk into my life from some stupid English play that I never acc managed to memorize, and made sure I never want them to leave. Sometimes I ask myself tho, how can i be sure she's the one? And then I get a call from you or a text, well even if I don't know who it's from, i rlly rlly hope it's you. I could be having the worst day of my life and just a simple call from you or a single text can make it so much better. I can't fully describe my feelings idek if I ever will be able to. All I can say is I hope with every fiber of my being that me and u work out, cos i can't ever imagine my life with anyone else, can't ever find anyone so perfect for me. 
<br><br>
We understand each other in ways I thought human understanding wasn't previously possible. From the beginning of the day to the very end it's me and u, whether we’re next to each other or not. And ur right, i agree, i'm not obsessed with you. I'm obsessed with what we have and with what we can become. I mean CMON i can never get tired of u i can never get enough of u and i mean that. Like rn ur not texting me rn and i'm sad abt it do better. Ok u just responded ANYWAY yea i love you i love you i love you
<br><br>
OH btw i'm addicted to the way u smell no joke like i can not go this long without it
<br><br>
WHo tf would have thought that me and u would ever make it this far, i mean yes we kept texting, but then we fell off and came back, but ngl idk if i've noticed, but when we did text, we never stopped. That was prolly a sign or a hint of what's to come but we didn't notice it. YK im acc so happy the shit happened the way it did like yes we both got our hearts mildly broken, but if u dont know what u have until u lose it and us both losing it made me know just how much we needed each other in our lives.
<br><br>
WELP might as well go into my biggest fears cos there's one big one left and it's kinda unfounded but still u got rid of all of the other ones. I mean cmon this is the most secure relationship in existence there ISNT even a chance we break up unless i get dumped in that case oof im bad at taking a hint BUT anyway yes i find u hot etc etc but i never ever want u to think i want u for ur body and i mean that. I fell in love with ur soul not ur body and it's not my fault the body is nice too LMao i sound so shitty but u get the point pls pls dont ever think that
<br><br>
Im here for u always, thru thick and thin, when ur mad, when ur sad, when ur angry, and whenever else idc im here, im urs and ur never getting rid of me
<br><br>
ANYWAY holding myself back from yapping more, HAPPY BIRTHDAY NITHYA UR 16
<br><br>
HOLY SHIT WE’RE BOTH 16 WE’re IN LOVE LIFE IS GOOD WE GOT THIS WE SHALL SUCCEED I LOVE U AND THE FUTURE IS OURS TO CONQUER
