                    <p>HIIII ig its time for me to write, write about me, you, about us? Maybe ill yap enough to get to writing about that eventually, actually i dont even know what to write about. Wait, thats not true, its just that I have so much to write about, i dont even know where to start. I have a feeling ima fall more in love just by writing this letter, but either way bucle in for pages and pages of straight yap. I HAVE AN IDEA, yk i promised you i'd tell u soon why i loved u or what i saw in you. The time is now. It has come. Time to reveal the secrets of the universe. If I had to condense what i saw in you short and sweet, I see you. Nithya Ravuri. All ive ever wanted, the intelligent, funny, reserved yet out of pocket, sweet yet dirty minded, cute yet hot girl i know. IG thats part of what makes u special, the balance that you have, in everything. The way u balance fun and academics the way u balance everything. I mean cmon every time we do smth i keep thinking “bro u better not lose this girl ur never ever finding another one like her” and that's true. I mean cmon who the fuck is gonna do half the shit we do together? Right back to the topic I see in you the balance, the calmness yet the idk inner anger that i always wanted. What I see in you is my better, half as cringey and shit as that sounds, I feel like we complete eachother. Soulmates. I see in you someone who ill never get bored of and someone who will never ever get bored of me. Someone who i can tell anything and anything(tho i already do) and someone who i'll never have to hide myself from. Someone who’ll never hide themselves from me. Someone who managed to walk into my life from some stupid english play that i never acc managed to memorize, and made sure id never want them to leave. I
